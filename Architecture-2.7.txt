funnybot

gatekeeper - Controls all threads and data-passes


watcher - watches threads created by gatekeeper for keep-alive signal, terminates any threads that hang too long


core - contains core network functionality
  
  network - opens and handles port interaction
  listener - listens for incoming data and hands it off to gatekeeper
  sender - sends data from gatekeeper to server
  funnydata - object for storing passed data
  funnydict - contains built-in funnybot variables
  funnybot - contains global functions for joining/leaving/quitting
  funnylog - stores various logs such as error, general or room logs


modules - contains modules that parse ALL data (Note: modules have a standard weight of 10, lower weights go first,
  negative weights only run on request of another module or function. A module has the option to mark data as 
  ‘processed’ which will cause the data NOT to move on to the next module, otherwise it will proceed to the next 
  module until all modules have seen the data) (weight,marks as processed)
  
    pong - module responsible for sending pong response to server (0,true)
    regex - module responsible for performing regex operations (10,false)
    linkinfo - module responsible for following links and providing info (10, false)
    autoop - module responsible for automatically op-ing people in rooms (10,false)
    autojoin - module responsible for automatically (re)joining rooms (10,false)
    autovar - automatically tries to convert unknown keywords to user vars (-1,true)
    keyword - runs function associated with keyword, passes keyword to autovar if unknown keyword. (2,true)
    ignore - ignores certain users (1,true)
    permissions - grants users permission to use specific functions (-1,false)


functions - contains modules that respond to a keyword (ex. if ?? is the marker then ??time would run a function
  that has registered time as a keyword)
    
    time - registers the ‘time’ keyword, responds with the current server time
    var - stores/gets/deletes user variables
    setkey - changes the default marker for that room (or globally)
    help - interactive help that explains modules/functions/syntax. Every module/function should add to the global
      help dictionary information about how they function.
    permissions - grants/denies permissions to users
    reload - reloads modules/functions/settings/dictionaries/variables. Also loads new/added modules/functions
    joke - tells a joke from the joke dictionary


settings - contains custom settings for funnybot
  
  network - network-connection related settings
  common - general settings such as the current keyword(s) and how much of a scrollback to save and if it should log.

        autoop - list of users to auto-op in a specific room
        regex - enabled/disabled in a specific room
        ignore - room-specific ignore list
